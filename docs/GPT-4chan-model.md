## GPT-4chan

[GPT-4chan](https://huggingface.co/ykilcher/gpt-4chan) has been shut down from Hugging Face, so you need to download it elsewhere. You have two options:

* Torrent: [16-bit](https://archive.org/details/gpt4chan_model_float16) / [32-bit](https://archive.org/details/gpt4chan_model)
* Direct download: [16-bit](https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/_notpdf_/gpt4chan_model_float16/) / [32-bit](https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/_notpdf_/gpt4chan_model/)

The 32-bit version is only relevant if you intend to run the model in CPU mode. Otherwise, you should use the 16-bit version.

After downloading the model, follow these steps:

1. Place the files under `models/gpt4chan_model_float16` or `models/gpt4chan_model`.
2. Place GPT-J 6B's config.json file in that same folder: [config.json](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B/raw/main/config.json).
3. Download GPT-J 6B's tokenizer files (they will be automatically detected when you attempt to load GPT-4chan):

```
python download-model.py EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B --text-only
```

When you load this model in default or notebook modes, the "HTML" tab will show the generated text in 4chan format.
